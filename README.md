# pyNetX

**pyNetX** is a Python library that facilitates both synchronous and asynchronous client-side scripting and application development around the NETCONF protocol. Developed by **Sambhu Nampoothiri G**, pyNetX provides a modern, efficient interface for interacting with NETCONF-enabled network devices — with truly asynchronous capabilities using non blocking connections.

> **Current Versions:**  
> Stable: **v1.0.6**

## Installation

You can install **pyNetX** in either of the following ways:

1. **From PyPI:**

   ```bash
   pip install pyNetX
   ```
2. **From Source:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jackofsometrades99/pyNetX.git
   cd pyNetX
   python setup.py install
   ```
## Examples

### Synchronous Usage

Below is an example of how to retrieve a device’s running configuration synchronously:

```python
from pyNetX import NetconfClient

# Create a NETCONF client instance
client = NetconfClient(
    hostname="192.168.1.1",
    port=830,
    username="admin",
    password="admin",
    connect_timeout=30, # CONNECT TIMEOUT FROM CHANNEL. DEFAULT IS 60 SECONDS
    read_timeout=30 # READ TIMEOUT FROM CHANNEL. DEFAULT IS 60 SECONDS
)

# Establish a connection
status = client.connect_sync()

# Retrieve the running configuration
config = client.get_config_sync(source="running")
print("Running Configuration:")
print(config)

# Disconnect from the device
client.disconnect_sync()
```
### Asynchronous Usage

The asynchronous API methods are provided with an *_async* suffix and integrate with Python’s asyncio. For example:

```python

import asyncio
from pyNetX import NetconfClient

async def main():
    client = NetconfClient(
        hostname="192.168.1.1",
        port=830,
        username="admin",
        password="admin",
        connect_timeout=30, # CONNECT TIMEOUT FROM CHANNEL. DEFAULT IS 60 SECONDS
        read_timeout=30 # READ TIMEOUT FROM CHANNEL. DEFAULT IS 60 SECONDS
    )
    
    # Asynchronously connect to the device
    await status = client.connect_async()
    
    # Retrieve configuration asynchronously
    config = await client.get_config_async(source="running")
    print("Running Configuration:")
    print(config)
    
    # Asynchronously disconnect from the device
    await client.disconnect_async()

# Run the asynchronous main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## API Overview

The main class provided by **pyNetX** is `NetconfClient`, which offers both synchronous and asynchronous methods for NETCONF operations.

### Synchronous Methods

- **`connect_sync()`**  
  Establishes a NETCONF session with the target device.

- **`disconnect_sync()`**  
  Closes the NETCONF session.

- **`send_rpc_sync(rpc)`**  
  Sends a custom RPC command.

- **`get_sync(filter="")`**  
  Retrieves device information using an optional filter.

- **`get_config_sync(source="running", filter="")`**  
  Retrieves the device configuration.

- **`copy_config_sync(target, source)`**  
  Copies configuration from one datastore to another.

- **`delete_config_sync(target)`**  
  Deletes configuration from the specified target.

- **`validate_sync(source="running")`**  
  Validates the configuration.

- **`edit_config_sync(target, config, do_validate=False)`**  
  Edits the device configuration.

- **`subscribe_sync(stream="NETCONF", filter="")`**  
  Subscribes to NETCONF notifications.

- **`receive_notification_sync()`**
  Fetches a single received notification from the notification channel.

- **`lock_sync(target="running")`** and **`unlock_sync(target="running")`**  
  Lock and unlock a configuration datastore, respectively.

- **`commit_sync()`**  
  Commits any configuration changes.

- **`locked_edit_config_sync(target, config, do_validate=False)`**  
  Performs an edit configuration operation while holding a lock.

### Asynchronous Methods

For every synchronous method, there is an asynchronous counterpart that returns an asyncio Future:

- **`connect_async()`**
- **`disconnect_async()`**
- **`send_rpc_async(rpc="")`**
- **`receive_notification_async()`**
- **`get_async(filter="")`**
- **`get_config_async(source="running", filter="")`**
- **`copy_config_async(target, source)`**
- **`delete_config_async(target)`**
- **`validate_async(source="running")`**
- **`edit_config_async(target, config, do_validate=False)`**
- **`subscribe_async(stream="NETCONF", filter="")`**
- **`lock_async(target="running")`**
- **`unlock_async(target="running")`**
- **`commit_async()`**
- **`locked_edit_config_async(target, config, do_validate=False)`**

## Common Methods.

These methods can be used in both synchronous and asynchronous operations:

- **`delete_subscription()`**
  Unsubscribe from recieving notifications.

- **`set_threadpool_size(nThreads)`**
  Sets the number of threads in the shared task pool. The default is 4 threads. The number of threads in the pool determines how many tasks or operations can run concurrently. Note that for each device, operations (such as get_async, edit_config_async, etc.) are executed sequentially using a lock to avoid channel corruption. This nThreads value controls the total number of concurrent operations across all clients (devices) in the application. To use this, you can simply:

  ```python
  import pyNetX
  pyNetX.set_threadpool_size(10)
  ```

## Exception Handling

**pyNetX** defines custom exceptions to handle various NETCONF-related errors:

- **`NetconfConnectionRefusedError`**  
  Raised when a connection attempt is refused.

- **`NetconfAuthError`**  
  Raised when authentication fails.

- **`NetconfChannelError`**  
  Raised for channel-related errors.

- **`NetconfException`**  
  The base exception for NETCONF-related issues.
